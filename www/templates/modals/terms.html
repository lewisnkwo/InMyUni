<h3><strong> The buying and selling process</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
13.1    ('Posted' delivery option) You agree that a contract for the sale and purchase of a product or products will come into force between you and another registered application user, and accordingly that you commit to buying or selling the relevant product or products, in the following circumstances:

(a)      A buyer must select the product (item) that he/she wants and they must press the 'Confirm Purchase' button to confirm that they want to purchase the product;

(b)      If the buyer is a new user, he or she must create an account with the application and log in; otherwise, the buyer must enter his or her login details;

(c)      Once the buyer is logged in, he or she must view the shipping method set by the seller; and will agree with the shipping (delivery) method ('Posted') by confirming the order; and his or her consent to these terms and conditions and the applicationlicable terms and conditions of sale;

(d)      The buyer will be transferred to the application of the applicationointed payment service provider (Stripe), and the payment service provider will handle the buyer's payment to the seller; buyers must submit payment in full via credit or debit card;

(e)      The application will then send to the buyer an automatically generated acknowledgement of payment (an order completion email);

(f)      After the order confirmation email is sent, at this point the order will become a binding contract between the seller and the buyer or the seller will confirm by email that it is unable to meet the buyer's order. The seller will then need to cancel the order (by marking the order as cancelled) in their seller dashboard ('My Inmyuni'). The seller will then need to refund the full amount to the buyer as soon as possible (if the denial of refunding has not be stated in the item description).

13.2    (Local 'Meet Up' delivery option) You agree that a contract for the sale and purchase of a product or products will come into force between you and another registered application user, and accordingly that you commit to buying or selling the relevant product or products, in the following circumstances:

(a)      A buyer must select the product (item) that he/she wants and they must press the 'Confirm Purchase' button to confirm that they want to purchase the product;

(b)      If the buyer is a new user, he or she must create an account with the application; confirm that they can 'meet up' local to their educational institution and log in; otherwise, the buyer must enter his or her login details;

(c)      Once the buyer is logged in, he or she must view the shipping method set by the seller; and will agree with the shipping (delivery) method ('Meet Up') by confirming the order; and his or her consent to these terms and conditions and the applicationlicable terms and conditions of sale. After the order confirmation email is sent, at this point the order will become a binding contract between the seller and the buyer or the seller will confirm by email that it is unable to meet the buyer's order. The seller will then need to cancel the order (by marking the order as cancelled) in their seller dashboard ('My Inmyuni'). The seller will then need to refund the full amount to the buyer as soon as possible (if no refunding has not be stated in the item description)

(d)      Please arrange to meet up in a reasonable location with the buy (you'll be directed to the order where you can send messages), and please pay by cash (in the full amount) only. Since this delivery method is not trackable on the application, we have no responsibility for the transaction (the exchange of cash for the product);

(e)      The application will then send to the buyer an automatically generated acknowledgement of payment (an order completion email), after the seller has marked the order as paid.

<ol start="14">
	<li>
<h3><strong> Terms and conditions of sale (for the 'Posted' delivery option)</strong></h3>
</li>
</ol>
14.1    Sellers must use the application interface to create legal notices applicationlying to their relationships with customers.

14.2    Sellers must ensure that:

(a)      Legal notices are sufficient to meet the seller's legal disclosure obligations and other legal obligations; and

(b)      They comply with all laws applicationlicable to their product listings and sales, including where applicationlicable the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and the Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002.

14.3    Except to the extent that a buyer and seller expressly agree otherwise / notwithstanding any terms agreed between a buyer and a seller, the following provisions will be incorporated into the contract of sale and purchase between the buyer and the seller:

(a)      The price for a product will be as stated in the relevant product listing;

(b)      delivery (shipping) charges, optional packaging charges (will be included in product's price), optional handling charges (will be included in product's price), optional administrative charges (will be included in product's price), optional insurance costs (will be included in product's price), other optional ancillary costs and charges, and VAT and other taxes will only be payable by the buyer if this is expressly and clearly stated in the product listing (will be included in product's price);

(c)      Deliveries of products must be made within 30 days following date the contract of sale comes into force or such shorter period as the buyer and seller may agree on the product listing;

(d)      appropriate means of delivery of products must be used by the seller; and

(e)      Products must conform in all material respects to the description of the products in the product listing and any other description of the products supplied or made available by the seller to the buyer.

14.4    Under the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000, a buyer who is a consumer may cancel a distance contract to purchase products from a seller acting in the course of a business where the contract was entered into under an organised distance sales scheme run by the seller (subject to the limitations set out in this Section 14.4). The buyer may exercise this cancellation right at any time within the period beginning upon the conclusion of the contract of sale and ending after 7 working days beginning with the day after the day on which the buyer receives the products. In order to cancel a contract in this way, the buyer must give to the seller written notice of cancellation. If the buyer cancels a contract on this basis, the buyer must promptly return the products to the seller. If the buyer cancels a contract on this basis, the buyer will be refunded in full (including the cost of sending the products to the buyer). However, the buyer will be responsible for paying the cost of returning the products to the seller. If the buyer cancels a contract on this basis and does not return the products to the seller, the seller may recover the products and charge the buyer for the costs the seller incurs in doing so. Similarly, if the buyer returns the products at the seller's expense, the seller may pass that expense on to the buyer. The buyer will have no such right of cancellation insofar as a contract relates to:

(a)      The supply of goods which constitute audio or video recordings or computer software and which have been unsealed by the buyer;

(b)      The supply of goods the price of which is dependent upon fluctuations in financial markets which the seller cannot control;

(c)      The supply of newspapers, periodicals or magazines;

(d)      The supply of goods made to the buyer's specifications or clearly personalised; or

(e)      The supply of goods which by reason of their nature cannot be returned or are liable to deteriorate or expire rapidly.

14.5    Both buyers and sellers undertake to comply with the agreed terms and conditions of sale and purchase.
